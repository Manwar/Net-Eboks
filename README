This is perl interface for http://eboks.dk/, Danish national email system. 

Included a simple POP server for proxying e-boks for simple mail reading.

Howto
=====

1) For windows you'll need strawberry perl from http://strawberryperl.com/ .

2) Install this module by opening command line and typing 'cpanm git://github.com/dk/Net-Eboks'
If this fails, try this: 'cpan Net::Eboks'.

3) On command line, type eboks2pop

4) Connect your mail client to POP3 server at localhost, where username is
your CPR code and your e-boks activation code, such as f.ex: 0123456-7890:kwdElkwjdc
and password is your mobile pincode. These can be found in your e-boks settings.

Enjoy!
